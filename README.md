Let me explain the key components of this solution:

Core Features:


Uses Streamlit for a clean, web-based chat interface
Implements string similarity matching using SequenceMatcher
Maintains chat history using Streamlit's session state
Falls back to a generic response when no good match is found


Error Handling:


Similarity threshold prevents incorrect matches
Session state initialization prevents errors
Input validation is handled by Streamlit


Code Structure:


SupportAgent class encapsulates the core logic
Methods are separated for clarity and maintainability
Clear naming conventions and comments

To run this:

Save as app.py
Install requirements: pip install streamlit
Run: streamlit run app.py

Some potential improvements (if time allowed):

Add more sophisticated text matching (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings)
Implement fuzzy matching for typos
Add typing hints
Add unit tests
Add logging
Save chat history
Add a confidence score display
